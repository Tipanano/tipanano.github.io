        <p>When you set up a spot you have some options to choose from:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Name: Try to pick a unique name for your spot, between 4 and 20 characters.</li>
                    <li>Payout amount: The amount that each payout should be, minimum 0.1 Nano.</li>
                    <li>Payout range: How far away the user of the app can be from where you place the spot to get a payout.</li>
                    <li>Payout frequency: How often a user of the app can get a payout, choose between every day, every week, or one time only.</li>
                    <li>Set up amount: The initial set up amount for this spot, minimum 10 Nano.</li>
                    <li>Duration in months: How long the spot should be active and pay out to users as long as the balance is above the payout amount.</li>
                    <li>Allow contributions: Decide if you want other users to be able to donate to your spot. Donations are a way for people to donate smaller amounts to a spot(down to 1 Nano), and also a way to refill popular spots.</ul>
                </ul>
                <p>In addition, a new spot can not have less than 10 payouts total. Meaning, if the initial set up amount is 10 Nano, the payout value can not be higher than 1 Nano.</p>
